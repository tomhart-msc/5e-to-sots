# Scene 03: GM Notes

## Tone
Solemn, mysterious, and alien. This tower is dedicated to the Sun God, not Denari, and its faith is alien to the characters.

## Notes
This is the first real test â€” a ritual of faith and tradition. I want the players to figure out what to do by examining their surroundings. 

The clues in this scene MUST tell the players EXPLICITLY how to perform the ritual to advance further into the tower.

## Obstacles
The players must determine and perform a lost ritual correctly to proceed to the next scene, which is the next floor of the tower. To complete the ritual, the PCs must don the robes from the sacristy, trace the sun symbol on their foreheads with the water from the font, bring in the items from the vestry, place the items on the altar and light the incense on the altar.

Clues should guide them toward the correct steps. Success opens the way forward. Failure causes a magical backlash. Desecration summons a guardian.

## Allow Invention
Yes
