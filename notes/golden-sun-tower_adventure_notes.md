# Adventure Notes

## Location
An island in the Bay of Coins outside Eversink

## Tone
A mysterious tower of an ancient god, holy but corrupted.

## Notes

- The Spire of the Sun God (Aten) is located on an island in the Bay of Coins: close to Eversink, but outside it.
- The PCs are here because one of them (Giovessi) runs a cult (The Cult of Hours), and he seeks to merge it with the Aten's religion and get a base of operations in the tower.
- The Church of Denari supports this: it gets the cult's centre outside of Eversink, while empowering a Sun God off it's coast, which should help shipping: that's a win-win situation.
- Aten's religion should be coded as Egyptian: Eversink uses Italian names, the Ancient Nobility use Roman names, and the Serpentine Empire uses Greek names. Coding the Sun God's religion as Egyptian is a shorthand for "older."
