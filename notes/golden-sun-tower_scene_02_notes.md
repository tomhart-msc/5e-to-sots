# Scene 02: GM Notes

## Notes
**CRITICAL**: Expand SIGNIFICANTLY on this scene.

The original D&D adventure glossed over how the PCs learn what to do, but Swords of the Serpentine is an investigative game, so in SotS, this investigation is the point of the game.

You **MUST** add, at a minimum, a library accessible from this location, and a spirit NPC the characters can talk to. Add other genre-appropriate opportunities for the PCs to use their Investigative Abilities to learn how to complete the test in this scene.

## Allow Invention
Yes
