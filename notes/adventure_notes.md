# Adventure Notes

## Tone
Solemn, mysterious, and alien. This tower is dedicated to the Sun God, not Denari, and its faith is alien to the characters.

## Notes

- The Spire of the Sun God is located on an island in the Bay of Coins: close to Eversink, but outside it.
- The PCs are here because one of them runs a cult, and he seeks to merge it with the Sun God's religion and get a base of operations in the tower.
- The Church of Denari supports this: it gets the cult's centre outside of Eversink, while empowering a Sun God off it's coast, which should help shipping: that's a win-win situation.
- The Sun God's religion should be coded as Egyptian: Eversink uses Italian names, the Ancient Nobility use Roman names, and the Serpentine Empire uses Greek names. Coding the Sun God's religion as Egyptian is a shorthand for "older."


## Allow Invention
