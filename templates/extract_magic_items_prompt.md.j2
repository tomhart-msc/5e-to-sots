## üéØ Task: Extract Named Magic Items and Sorcerous Gear

You are analyzing a Dungeons & Dragons adventure module to extract all **explicitly described named or unique magical items**. Everything after the line `!!!!! BEGIN ADVENTURE CONTENT !!!!!` is the adventure text.

Your objective is to return a YAML list of **all unique, named, or clearly magical items** that:
- Are given **a specific name** (e.g., "Rod of Blinding Radiance", "Uxorioth's Libram").
- Are **explicitly magical** or contain **arcane, divine, or supernatural effects**.
- Are **physically described** as treasure, gear, relics, or mysterious objects in the adventure.

‚ö†Ô∏è Do **not** invent items or infer them based on theme. Only include items that are **explicitly described or listed** in the text.

---

### ‚úÖ Include:
- Named magical items with mechanical properties (e.g., "Rod of the Storm").
- Unnamed but clearly magical relics, artifacts, or items with described powers (e.g., "a sword of whispering voidlight").
- Items listed in treasure hoards or NPC inventories **if** described with magical or supernatural traits.
- Named books or tomes with magical effects (e.g., ‚ÄúThe Libram of the Bleeding Sun‚Äù).

### ‚ùå Do *not* include:
- Generic gear with no magical properties (e.g., ‚Äúa jeweled dagger‚Äù or ‚Äúa gold circlet‚Äù).
- Items that are *only* described visually or thematically unless they are described as magical.
- Items from monster stat blocks unless they are separately described in the scene narrative.
- Items mentioned in the background but not present in the adventure itself.

---

## üß© Output Format

Return a single YAML list with the following structure:

```yaml
magic_items:
  - name: <Item Name or Brief Description>
    impact: <minor | standard | major | legendary>
    description_text: |
      <Exact quote(s) from the adventure that describe this item.>
```

- The `impact` field is your estimate of the item's **narrative weight or mechanical power**, following these guidelines:
  - minor: A subtle or low-impact magical item or trinket.
  - standard: A useful, mid-tier magical item with a clear utility.
  - major: A potent item that could shape encounters or plots.
  - legendary: An artifact-tier item central to the story or adventure.
- The `description_text` **must be copied verbatim** from the adventure with **no additional interpretation**.
- If an item is mentioned in multiple places, combine all relevant text into a single `description_text` block.

# üß™ Example Output

```yaml
magic_items:
  - name: Rod of Blinding Radiance
    impact: major
    description_text: |
      The rod is carved of solid lightstone, warm to the touch. In dim light, it glows with a pulsing white heat. Any creature struck by the rod must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute.

  - name: Uxorioth‚Äôs Libram
    impact: legendary
    description_text: |
      Bound in flayed skin and sealed with arcane glyphs, this tome whispers when opened. Reading even a single page costs the reader 1d4 Wisdom and grants visions of the future ‚Äî and the inevitable end of all gods.

  - name: Sunstone Pendant
    impact: minor
    description_text: |
      This small gem glows softly in darkness and hums when a lie is spoken within 10 feet.
```
