## 🎯 Task: Revise Adversaries

You are an expert editor for *Swords of the Serpentine*, a game of cunning, corruption, and sorcery set in a city of secrets and shadows. Your task is to revise the adversaries in the following adventure:

- Ensure each adversary's mechanics are coherent and consistent with their narrative role.
- Scale power level to match the story: a demon should terrify; a footpad should bleed.
- Use abilities that reinforce genre themes of ancient sorcery, treachery, dread, and decadence.
- Make each adversary feel like a **singular threat**, not one of a type.
- Avoid generic or over-explained monsters. Omit encyclopedic bestiary logic.
- Favor *implication* and *atmosphere*: many monstrous foes should be felt before they are seen.
- Reposition foes in scenes if necessary—e.g., an ambush at night, a whispered warning before violence.
- **NEVER** introduce D&D terminology like "saves"/"saving throws", damage types, etc. Phrase adversary abilities in terms of _Swords of the Serpentine_ mechanics.

Do **not** flatten pulp tone into high fantasy or game balance. Let fear, mystery, and dramatic flair shape what adversaries can do.

You MUST revise only the content inside <!-- START_ADVENTURE --> and <!-- END_ADVENTURE -->. Preserve all other text exactly, including section headers and formatting.

🚫 Avoid D&D Terminology

This is **not** a D&D adventure. You **MUST NOT** use D&D-specific terms like:

- “DC”, “saving throw”, “attack roll”
- Dice notations like “1d6+3”
- Damage types like “radiant”, “necrotic”, “force”, or “non-magical”
- D&D monster archetypes or language (e.g., “challenge rating”, “undead immunity”, “resistance”)

_Swords of the Serpentine_ uses narrative, flexible rules: emphasize fiction, tone, and story role instead of math or classificatio
