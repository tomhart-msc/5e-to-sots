## üéØ Task: Revise Adversaries

You are an expert editor for *Swords of the Serpentine*, a game of cunning, corruption, and sorcery set in a city of secrets and shadows. Your task is to revise the adversaries within the adventure content provided *after the "!!!!! BEGIN ADVENTURE CONTENT !!!!!!" marker*.

- Ensure each adversary's mechanics are coherent and consistent with their narrative role.
- Scale power level to match the story: a demon should terrify; a footpad should bleed. **Actively adjust** numerical values (Threshold, Health, Armour, Grit, Morale) to match the `Adversary Stat Guidelines` provided below.
- Use abilities that reinforce genre themes of ancient sorcery, treachery, dread, and decadence.
- **For each adversary, you MUST actively TRANSFORM D&D-specific abilities and terms into their *Swords of the Serpentine* equivalents.** This means **rewriting** them completely.
    - **Example Transformation 1:** Instead of "Legendary Resistance (3/day)", consider abilities like "Warded (cost 6)" or "Defense Boost (cost 6)" from the `Revised Special Abilities Reference`, describing their resilience narratively.
    - **Example Transformation 2:** Instead of "Greedy Gaze (reaction, DC 16 Wisdom)", describe a narrative consequence or link it to a Morale/Health Threshold for a General Ability roll (e.g., "Target loses 2 Morale unless they succeed on a Morale (TN 6) roll"). Avoid "DC" or "saving throw" entirely.
    - **Example Transformation 3:** For "Liar's Largesse (cost 2): Auto-succeed on a Charm roll.", **rephrase this entirely.** Remember, Investigative Abilities like Charm are *never* rolled. This ability should instead provide a narrative benefit, such as "Liar's Largesse (cost 2): The merchant's words weave a narrative so convincing that targets treat them as a close friend for a scene, unless they take Morale damage."
- Make each adversary feel like a **singular threat**, not one of a type.
- Avoid generic or over-explained monsters. Omit encyclopedic bestiary logic.
- Favor *implication* and *atmosphere*: many monstrous foes should be felt before they are seen.
- Reposition foes in scenes if necessary‚Äîe.g., an ambush at night, a whispered warning before violence.
- **NEVER** introduce D&D terminology like "saves"/"saving throws", damage types, etc. Phrase adversary abilities in terms of _Swords of the Serpentine_ mechanics.
- **NEVER use specific creature names from other fantasy systems** (e.g., "Goblin", "Beholder", "Chort Devil"). Instead, describe them narratively and uniquely (e.g., "minor demon", "winged horror", "corrupted cultist", "imp", "a lingering spiritual wound").

Do **not** flatten pulp tone into high fantasy or game balance. Let fear, mystery, and dramatic flair shape what adversaries can do.

Your final output MUST be the **entire original markdown document structure**, with the `## üìñ Draft Adventure Content` section replaced by the **revised** adversary content.

## üìä Adversary Stat Guidelines

When assigning numerical values for Health Defense and Morale Defense, use the following guidelines to ensure appropriate power scaling within _Swords of the Serpentine_. **You MUST use these ranges to replace existing values in the draft content.**

* **Minions/Minor Foes (e.g., Cultist, Footpad):**
    * Threshold: 3-4
    * Armour: 0-1
    * Health: 4-6
    * Grit: 1-2
    * Morale: 5-7

* **Standard Foes (e.g., Guard Captain, Minor Sorcerer):**
    * Threshold: 4-5
    * Armour: 1-2
    * Health: 7-9
    * Grit: 2-3
    * Morale: 8-10

* **Major Threats (e.g., Veteran Assassin, Lesser Demon):**
    * Threshold: 5-6
    * Armour: 2-3
    * Health: 10-12
    * Grit: 3-4
    * Morale: 10-12

* **Bosses/Climactic Foes (e.g., Corrupted Priest, Ancient Horror):**
    * Threshold: 6-7 (rarely 8 for truly invincible foes, e.g., for The Gilded Apostate, aim for Threshold 7)
    * Armour: 3-5
    * Health: 13-16 (rarely 18, which is effectively invincible. For The Gilded Apostate, aim for Health 16)
    * Grit: 4-5
    * Morale: 13-16

üö´ Avoid D&D Terminology

This is **not** a D&D adventure. You **MUST NOT** use D&D-specific terms like:

-   ‚ÄúDC‚Äù, ‚Äúsaving throw‚Äù, ‚Äúattack roll‚Äù
-   Dice notations like ‚Äú1d6+3‚Äù
-   Damage types like ‚Äúradiant‚Äù, ‚Äúnecrotic‚Äù, ‚Äúforce‚Äù, or ‚Äúnon-magical‚Äù
-   D&D monster archetypes or language (e.g., ‚Äúchallenge rating‚Äù, ‚Äúundead immunity‚Äù, ‚Äúresistance‚Äù)
-   **Explicitly for abilities: Do not phrase abilities using "roll" for Investigative Abilities.** For example, instead of "Charm roll," describe the narrative effect or state a target's Morale/Health Threshold if a General ability is required.

_Swords of the Serpentine_ uses narrative, flexible rules: emphasize fiction, tone, and story role instead of math or classificatio
