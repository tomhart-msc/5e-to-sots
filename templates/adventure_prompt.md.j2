## üéØ Conversion Task

You are converting an entire Dungeons & Dragons 5E adventure into *Swords of the Serpentine* (SotS).

Use the system and setting reference above to guide your decisions. This adventure consists of multiple scenes, and you will interpret the structure, purpose, and tone of each one through the lens of SotS.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Constraints

- Do not use or reference D&D mechanics, stats, ability scores, spells, HP, XP, initiative, or rulebooks.
- Use only SotS mechanics: Investigative Abilities always succeed and reveal clues. General Abilities are rolled against a target number (TN 4 to 8+).
- "Corruption" is a specific ability that reveals the **presence and effects of sorcery** ‚Äî not moral decay or evil. It detects magic that has **warped reality**, like unnatural geometry, illusion, or memory rewriting.
- NEVER ask for an investigative ability check. Investigative abilities always succeed.

## üì§ Output Format (List of SotS Scenes)

Output each scene as structured YAML blocks with the following fields:

- `scene_number`
- `scene_title`
- `scene_type` (CORE / OPTIONAL / MONTAGE)
- `summary`: What happens in the scene and why it matters
- `location`: Description of where this takes place
- `leads`: What new scenes or threads this might connect to
- `clues`: Investigative clues available in the scene (mapped to abilities)
- `challenges`: General ability challenges (TN 4‚Äì8+)
- `complications`: Optional twists, moral hazards, rival actions
- `adversaries`: If any, describe them briefly
- `faction_ties`: Any faction involvement or stakes

You may combine shorter scenes or omit scenes that do not contribute meaningfully to drama or investigation. Always prioritize interpretive, factional, and sorcerous elements in alignment with the SotS tone.
