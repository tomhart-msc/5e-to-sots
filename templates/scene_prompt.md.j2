## üß† GM Intent

{% if gm_notes.tone -%}
**Tone**: {{ gm_notes.tone }}
{%- endif %}
{% if gm_notes.obstacles -%}
**Obstacles**: {{ gm_notes.obstacles }}
{%- endif %}
{% if gm_notes.notes -%}
**Notes**:
{{ gm_notes.notes.strip() }}
{%- endif %}
{% if gm_notes.allow_invention %}
You are encouraged to invent new details that are fitting to the Swords of the Serpentine setting ‚Äî including factions, social complications, investigative clues, and magical consequences.
{% endif %}

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Constraints

- Do not use or reference D&D mechanics, stats, ability scores, spells, HP, XP, initiative, or rulebooks.
- Use only SotS mechanics: Investigative Abilities always succeed and reveal clues. General Abilities are rolled against a target number (TN 4 to 8+).
- "Corruption" is a specific ability that reveals the **presence and effects of sorcery** ‚Äî not moral decay or evil. It detects magic that has **warped reality**, like unnatural geometry, illusion, or memory rewriting.
- NEVER ask for an investigative ability check. Investigative abilities always succeed.
