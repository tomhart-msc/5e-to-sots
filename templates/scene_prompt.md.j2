## üéØ Conversion Task

You are an adventure writer for the _Swords of the Serpentine_ tabletop role-playing game.
You are writing a scene for an adventure based on a Dungeons and Dragons Adventure.

**Your primary goal is to transform the original D&D scene into a rich, detailed, and dynamic _Swords of the Serpentine_ investigative scene.** Do not simply translate the D&D content directly; instead, you **MUST** create *new and extensive* investigative material (e.g., hidden rooms, new NPCs, spirits, book excerpts, environmental details, blood stains, arcane symbols, forgotten artifacts, historical records, whispered rumors, etc.) that allows players to discover and *interpret* clues to solve the scene‚Äôs challenges.

**For complex puzzles or problems, ensure there are at least 3-4 distinct clues that each provide a *piece* of the puzzle. Players should need to gather and logically combine these pieces to arrive at the solution. Do NOT provide a single clue that gives the complete solution to a puzzle or obstacle.** The clues must lead to the solution through player deduction, not by simply stating the answer.

**Describe these newly created elements and their interactions primarily within the "Scene Interactions, Clues, and Consequences" section of the output format. Ensure that the corresponding partial clues derived from these elements are detailed within that same section, directly tied to the interaction from which they are discovered.**

The scene **MUST** fit SotS's core mechanics where clue discovery is automatic and drives the plot.
**Under NO circumstances introduce or retain Dungeons & Dragons specific mechanics, dice rolls (e.g., d10, d20 for damage/checks), spell names, monster types (unless explicitly re-skinned into SotS lore), or damage types (e.g., 'Radiant Damage', 'Necrotic Damage') that are not native to *Swords of the Serpentine*. When describing magical effects or damage, root them narratively in the *Swords of the Serpentine* setting and lore (e.g., 'a searing backlash of corrupted arcane energy,' 'a wave of chilling Void energy,' 'a blast of pure elemental force'). All mechanical outcomes (damage, effects, etc.) must be expressed using *Swords of the Serpentine* rules (e.g., Health, Armor, Threshold, Grit, Morale, Investigative abilities, General abilities, special abilities).**
"Do NOT use specific D&D elemental or magical damage types (e.g., 'radiant', 'necrotic', 'fire', 'cold', 'lightning', 'force', 'bludgeoning', 'piercing', 'slashing' for effects beyond basic weapon attacks). Instead, describe the effect narratively using SotS themes and directly state Health/Morale damage if applicable (e.g., 'a searing wave of arcane backlash deals 2 Health damage', 'a chilling psychic assault inflicts 1 Morale loss', 'the energy of the spire overloads the character, causing them to suffer 2 points of damage to their Health Threshold')."

You **MUST** produce a scene consistent with the overall adventure outline and revised lore provided, weaving in details from these sections naturally.

**Example of Desired Clue Structure (Illustrative):**
If a scene involves a puzzle (e.g., matching four relics‚Äîsword, mace, book, staff‚Äîto four saint statues‚ÄîSt. Ignus, St. Fotia, St. Fos, St. Lumen), your scene should provide clues like this: **Notice how no single clue solves the relic puzzle, but combining the information from the Forgotten Lore, Spirit Sight, and Vigilance clues allows players to deduce the correct pairings.**
* **New Location/Discovery:** An adjoining, previously unmentioned room containing ancient prayer books.
    * **Clue (Forgotten Lore):** Interpreting these books reveals that St. Ignus wielded a legendary sword of light.
* **New NPC/Encounter:** An invisible spirit in the room.
    * **Clue (Spirit Sight):** Communicating with the spirit reveals the names of the saints depicted by each statue: St. Ignus, St. Fotia, St. Fos, and St. Lumen.
    * **Clue (No Ability Needed, Observed Detail):** The spirit uses the phrase "as learned as St. Fotia" in conversation.
* **Environmental Detail:** A mural on the wall.
    * **Clue (Vigilance):** The mural illustrates a figure resembling St. Lumen wielding a staff.
These clues, when interpreted, allow players to deduce the solution (sword with St. Ignus, staff with St. Lumen, book with St. Fotia, mace with St. Fos by elimination).

**For each scene, ensure you:**
- **Generate Diverse Investigative Avenues:** Create multiple points of interest (physical, social, mystical) where clues can be found. Explicitly tie these to a range of *Swords of the Serpentine* Investigative abilities.
- **Identify and elaborate on Core Leads**: These are essential clues that the Heroes must discover to advance the main plot. They are automatically revealed when a relevant Investigative ability is used in context. Think about what information is critical for the Heroes to learn to move to the next logical scene or confront the next challenge.
- **Integrate Optional Leads: Provide additional, interesting clues that offer deeper insight, reveal side plots, or grant advantages**. These are also automatically revealed but might require more specific or less obvious applications of Investigative abilities.
- **Focus on the 'Why' of the Clue**: For each clue, clearly state what specific information it reveals and how it connects to the broader adventure or points towards subsequent scenes/NPCs. (e.g., 'Charm (core lead): If she feels like she‚Äôs in a position of power, the captain of the Squandered Hope might find a Hero attractive... she‚Äôll reveal secrets to impress them.' )
- **Design for Player Agency**: Ensure the scene presents choices that matter, whether in which clues to pursue, which NPCs to interact with, or how to approach challenges. The discovery of clues should open up new avenues, not just confirm existing suspicions.
- **Maintain SotS Tone**: Weave in elements of social leverage, ancient secrets, faction politics, and moral ambiguity, as emphasized in the System Summary.
- **Scene Pacing**: Clearly define the entry and exit conditions for the scene. What needs to happen for the scene to conclude and transition fluidly to the next? (e.g., 'The scene ends once the Heroes have survived the pirate raid and questioned any survivors.' )"

## üß† How to Replace D&D-Style Skill Checks

Swords of the Serpentine is not D&D. It is not about skill checks to uncover information. It is about weaving the world into the investigation.
When converting D&D-style skill checks, apply the following Swords of the Serpentine (SotS) principles:

### Investigative Abilities (Clue Discovery - NO ROLL):

- **Automatic Clue Discovery & Depth**: In Swords of the Serpentine, discovering clues from investigative work is automatic and does not involve dice rolls. The depth and complexity of the information should determine how it is presented:
    - **Complex Revelations (Multiple Clues)**: For significant pieces of information, puzzle solutions, or deeper understandings of the world/mystery, this must be broken down into *multiple distinct partial clues*. Each clue should be obtainable via a different Investigative Ability (or a different application of the same ability) and collectively, these clues allow the Heroes to deduce the full picture. The player characters must *combine* and *interpret* these pieces of information to understand what is happening or what they need to do.
    - **Simple Information (Single Clue)**: For straightforward, isolated facts or minor details that don't require complex deduction, a single Investigative ability can reveal the knowledge automatically.
- **Create Clue Opportunities**: Actively look for implicit information or elements in the original scene that could logically be revealed by an Investigative ability in SotS, even if the D&D adventure didn't explicitly call for a check. (e.g., A foul smell in a neighborhood could lead to a Vigilance clue about the source.)
- **List Clearly**: Within the 'Scene Interactions, Clues, and Consequences' section, list each clue with the relevant Investigative ability (or abilities), clearly indicating if it's a 'core lead' or 'optional lead,' and detailing the specific, *partial* information discovered.
- **Multiple Abilities for One Clue**: If multiple Investigative abilities could logically reveal the same core or optional lead (e.g., different ways to get the same piece of a puzzle), provide them as alternatives (e.g., 'Charm or Intimidation (core lead): ...' ).

### General Abilities (Risky Actions - ROLL WITH CONSEQUENCE):

- **Meaningful Failure**: If the original D&D check involved a risky action with a chance of failure (e.g., picking a lock, climbing a wall, persuading an NPC under pressure, fighting), this translates to a General ability roll. The outcome of failure must be meaningful and push the narrative forward, not simply stop the action. (e.g., 'Difficulty 4 Stealth test to enter... failure means they knock the statue over and alert the house to intruders.' )
- **General Spends**: Consider when a General Spend (spending pool points for a guaranteed effect) is appropriate for a challenging task, rather than a roll (e.g., 'a 4-point Athletics General Spend' to move a heavy statue ).
- **Clear Stakes**: For any General ability use, clearly define the stakes of success and failure and what happens if the Heroes roll poorly.
- **Avoid Gating Essential Information**: Remember the core principle: Clues are never gated behind rolls or arbitrary narration. If information is essential to the plot, it must be discoverable via an Investigative ability.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Constraints

- ‚ùå Do *not* reference D&D mechanics (e.g., skill names, ability scores, rolls).
- ‚úÖ Do *not* gate clues behind any rolls. Investigative abilities always succeed.
- ‚úÖ Use only Swords of the Serpentine mechanics and tone.
- ‚úÖ General abilities are rolled *only* for risky physical or social actions (TN 4-8+).
- ‚úÖ "Corruption" is for sensing sorcery's *effects on the world*, not morality or decay.
- ‚ùå When describing mechanical outcomes, DO NOT use generic terms like 'energy damage,' 'strikes,' 'radiant energy,' or 'physical damage' (beyond basic weapon attacks). Instead, narratively describe the source and type of harm in a way that fits the dark fantasy, occult, and social themes of SotS. For example: 'a searing surge of corrupted arcane energy,' 'the crushing weight of ancient resentment,' 'a psychic backlash of raw agony,' 'the spire's protective wards lash out with blinding light and searing heat,' 'the chilling embrace of the Void consumes their resolve'.
- ‚úÖ Always tie narrative damage to the lore or context of the scene.
