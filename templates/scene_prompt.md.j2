## üß† How to Replace D&D-Style Skill Checks

Swords of the Serpentine is not D&D. It is not about skill checks to uncover information. It is about weaving the world into the investigation.

- If a D&D scene used **Intelligence (Religion)** or **Investigation**, you must not translate that into a roll or "check" of any kind.
- Instead, ask: *What detail in the environment could convey that information?* Then describe how **Investigative Abilities** uncover it.
- Be creative. Add new objects, visions, writing, spirits, murals, or reactions from NPCs ‚Äî anything the players could notice, question, or infer.
- Label each clue with the appropriate Investigative Ability. These abilities are never rolled ‚Äî they *automatically* succeed if used.

**Example**  
If the D&D scene says:  
> "Make an Intelligence (Religion) check to identify the statue."  
You should instead write:  
> ‚ÄúThe statue depicts a forgotten Sun God of renewal.  
> - **Forgotten Lore (Core Lead):** The hieroglyphs mark the deity as ‚ÄòRe-Aten,‚Äô a pre-Denari sun aspect. Worship of him ended centuries ago.‚Äù

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Constraints

- ‚ùå Do *not* reference D&D mechanics (e.g., skill names, ability scores, rolls).
- ‚úÖ Do *not* gate clues behind any rolls. Investigative abilities always succeed.
- ‚úÖ Use only Swords of the Serpentine mechanics and tone.
- ‚úÖ General abilities are rolled *only* for risky physical or social actions (TN 4‚Äì8+).
- ‚úÖ "Corruption" is for sensing sorcery‚Äôs *effects on the world*, not morality or decay.
