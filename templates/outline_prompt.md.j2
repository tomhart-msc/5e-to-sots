‚ö†Ô∏è Important Constraints
If the scene has no challenge or obstacle, omit the objective_to_progress, required_steps, etc.

Do not invent goals or rituals unless they clearly exist in the original text.

If a scene is just atmospheric or connective, mark needs_conversion: false

Favor scenes with investigation, ambiguity, social danger, or ancient power.

Avoid generic monsters or combat-only encounters unless they‚Äôre symbolic or factional.
