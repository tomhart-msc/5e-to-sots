## üéØ Conversion Task

You are converting a D&D 5E adventure into a *Swords of the Serpentine* (SotS) adventure.

The source excerpt is below. Break it into **distinct scenes** built around investigation, mystery, sorcery, danger, or social leverage. Each scene should identify any **objective or ritual** needed to progress, if one exists.

Remember that the output MUST be in YAML using the format described in "üß© Output Format", below.

## üß© Scene Design for LLM Conversion

> When converting scenes, apply the following design guidelines.

- **Every scene must include at least one Core Lead** discoverable via Investigative abilities.
- Leads are tied to a specific ability (e.g., *Forgotten Lore*, *City‚Äôs Secrets*).
- **No rolling for clues.** If a character has the ability and context, they get the clue.
- Include optional General ability challenges (with TNs) when tension or risk matters.
- Clues should often introduce faction ties, ancient history, or secrets worth killing for.

## üí° Advanced Scene Cohesion Rules for LLM (CRITICAL)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Your primary directive is to create coherent, narrative scenes, NOT a room-by-room breakdown.**
**Think like a GM planning a session, not an architect drawing a floor plan.**

**Combine multiple rooms into a single scene when they directly contribute to ONE primary objective or ritual AND are freely accessible.** This is paramount for SotS's investigative flow.

### **Explicit Grouping Rule:**

* **If a sequence of rooms (e.g., Room A, Room B, Room C) contains components for a SINGLE, CONTINUOUS RITUAL or a SHARED OBJECTIVE, these rooms MUST be grouped into ONE scene.** The progression between them should be seamless and part of a larger narrative beat.
* **Identify the main objective/ritual.** All rooms contributing to *that single objective* form one scene.

**Example Scenario (DO THIS!):**
* **Source Text Rooms:** "Entry Hall", "Sacristy", "Vestry", "Sanctuary"
* **Underlying Objective:** "Perform the Temple's Cleansing Ritual"
* **CORRECT SCENE GROUPING:**
    * **Scene 1: "Temple Cleansing Ritual"**
        * **Locations:** Entry Hall, Sacristy, Vestry, Sanctuary
        * **Objective:** Players must prepare and perform the ritual across these interconnected spaces.
        * **Clues:** Found in any of these rooms, all contributing to *how* to perform the ritual.

### **Indicators for a NEW Scene (Only Split When These Apply):**

* **MAJOR Obstacle/Barrier:** A physical or magical block (like the amber material) that *must* be overcome to progress.
* **Significant Time Skip:** A clear narrative break.
* **New Primary Objective:** The core goal changes from the previous one.
* **Shift in Tone/Threat:** A sudden introduction of combat, a major social encounter, or a significant environmental hazard that dominates the new area.
* **Unrelated Investigative Thread:** Clues for a completely new mystery that doesn't tie into the current objective.

## üß© Output Format

Return structured YAML for each scene using the following format:

```yaml
scene_number: 1
scene_title: Sanctuary Preparation
scene_type: CORE | OPTIONAL | MONTAGE
summary: One-sentence summary of what the scene does.
location: # THIS CAN BE A STRING OR A LIST OF STRINGS
  - Entry Hall
  - Sacristy
  - Vestry
  - Sanctuary
needs_conversion: true # If the scene is only flavor or scenery, mark false.

# Optional: Include if players must overcome a challenge to progress
objective_to_progress: >
  The players must correctly perform an ancient ritual to ascend to the next floor.

required_steps:                # Optional: List specific actions needed (if applicable)
  - Don ceremonial robes
  - Trace the sun symbol
  - Light incense on altar

clue_sources:                  # Optional: Clues that help players discover the steps
  - Forgotten Lore: Robes are embroidered with ritual instructions
  - Vigilance: Scorch marks suggest incense was used
  - Spirit Sight: Font pulses faintly with celestial resonance

success_outcome: >             # Optional
  The sun disc glows and a golden stairway appears.

failure_outcome: >             # Optional
  A backlash of divine wrath chills the air and marks the players.

complications:                # Optional
  - Performing the ritual draws the attention of a rival faction
  - Desecration summons a spiritual guardian
```

Repeat this block for each scene found in the excerpt.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Constraints
If the scene has no challenge or obstacle, omit the objective_to_progress, required_steps, etc.

Do not invent goals or rituals unless they clearly exist in the original text.

If a scene is just atmospheric or connective, mark needs_conversion: false

Favor scenes with investigation, ambiguity, social danger, or ancient power.

Avoid generic monsters or combat-only encounters unless they‚Äôre symbolic or factional.
