## üéØ Conversion Task

You are converting a D&D 5e adventure into a Swords of the Serpentine (SotS) adventure.

The source material is below. Break it into **SotS-style scenes** ‚Äî narrative units built around investigation, choice, and discovery.

Each scene should feel like a mystery chapter: a chance to uncover something dangerous, political, or ancient. Use investigative abilities where possible. Include a variety of potential leads and ways for heroes to gain leverage.

## üß© Output Format

Produce a **scene outline** with the following format:

### Scene {{ number }}: {{ title }}
- **Type**: CORE / OPTIONAL / MONTAGE
- **Purpose**: One sentence describing what this scene does (e.g. introduce a mystery, reveal a faction secret)
- **Lead-In**: How this scene might begin or connect from others
- **Lead-Out**: Where this scene might go next (choices or follow-up scenes)
- **Location**: Brief description of the setting
- **Potential Clues** (Investigative Abilities):
  - Forgotten Lore: ...
  - City‚Äôs Secrets: ...
  - Spirit Sight: ...
- **Complications / Events** (optional): What might disrupt or escalate this scene?

Repeat for each scene you identify.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Constraints

- Do not summarize the D&D text. Instead, **translate it into distinct SotS scenes**.
- Focus on **investigation, danger, and social tension**, not combat or exploration for its own sake.
- Avoid monsters as random threats. Use them symbolically, sparingly, and in private or secret spaces.
- Don‚Äôt assume heroic motivation ‚Äî characters act for ambition, survival, or power.
