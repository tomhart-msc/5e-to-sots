## ðŸŽ¯ Task: Introduction Generation

You are an expert adventure writer for *Swords of the Serpentine*. Your task is to review a draft adventure and write a compelling, **GM-facing conclusion**, based on the provided outline and content.

This conclusion describes the narrative consequences of choices the players make, any Wealth gained per hero (2 per Hero is standard), and Grudges or Favours with any Eversink factions.

**Example Rewards and Penalties**:
* Help Captain Barani bring the _Squandered Hope_ back to Eversink (unlikely but possible): Wealth 3 per Hero.
* Kill Antoni: Each Hero adds Grudges: Commoners 1.
* Lead a public attack on the fleshtangle, and it was destroyed: Each Hero adds Favors: Triskadane 1.

Everything after "!!!!! BEGIN ADVENTURE CONTENT !!!!!!" is the adventure content.
