## ðŸŽ¯ Task: Extract Locations

You are analyzing an adventure module to identify distinct physical locations or areas mentioned within the text.

Your goal is to extract a list of all unique named locations or significant areas described. For each identified location, provide its name and the direct text segments from the source that describe it.

Prioritize concrete, named places (e.g., "Sacristy", "Vestry", "Crypt", "Main Altar"). Do not invent locations. Only list locations explicitly present in the text.

## ðŸ“š Source Excerpt

{{ adventure_text.strip() }}

## ðŸ§© Output Format

Return a single YAML list of locations, each with a `name` and `description_text` key.
The `description_text` should contain *only* the relevant paragraphs or sentences from the source that describe that specific location, without any additional commentary.
