## Adventure Setting

You **MUST** begin your output by explicitly stating the adventure's primary continental setting as designated here. This setting **OVERWRITES** any implied continental placement from other reference materials (e.g., Eversink for continental placement of *this specific adventure*). You **MUST** then **integrally weave this specified location's lore and characteristics into every relevant aspect of your adaptation.**

This adventure is located in: {{ adventure_gm_notes.location }}

## GM Intent: Special Naming Instructions and Context

Carefully review the "Notes" section of the GM Intent below. This section provides critical context for the adventure's lore and may contain **specific guidance on character origins or affiliations that imply unique naming conventions.** While the `Default Culture` setting provides the primary naming guidance for this adventure, look for details here that might suggest a different cultural origin for **specific individuals or groups within the adventure.**

## Naming Conventions for Renaming Table

These specific rules govern the generation of new names for NPCs and adversaries, taking precedence over general lore adaptation directives.

When generating `sots_name` for characters and entities in the `renaming_table`, strictly adhere to the following priority order and guidelines:

1.  **Primary Naming Convention for This Adventure: Based on Default Culture.**
    {%- if adventure_gm_notes.default_culture %}
    * **For all new NPCs and adversaries in this adventure, the default naming convention is {{ adventure_gm_notes.default_culture.strip() }}.** This applies unless a more specific override (as per point 2) is clearly indicated.
    * **Crucially, if the `Default Culture` in the GM notes is intended to signify "older" or "ancient" origins for characters (as implied by adventure context), apply this {{ adventure_gm_notes.default_culture.strip() }} naming convention to all characters associated with such ancient origins or historical elements. When this applies, names MUST be *exclusively* from the designated Default Culture, without any mixing or blending of elements from other regional naming conventions (e.g., Roman, Italian, Greek). Ensure names are culturally cohesive and authentic to the Default Culture.**
    * **Therefore, if a `Default Culture` is provided and applies to the characters, the "General Regional Naming Conventions" below are *not* to be used for character naming in this `renaming_table`.**
    {%- else %}
    * No specific default culture is set for this adventure. For naming, draw upon the cultural implications of the `Adventure Setting` and `world_reference` to ensure names are cohesive with the immediate geographic context.
    {%- endif %}

2.  **Specific Overrides: Derived from GM Intent.**
    * If the "GM Intent: Special Naming Instructions and Context" (if present) provides explicit, overriding naming rules for **specific individuals or categories** of characters based on their unique origins or roles within the adventure (e.g., "pirates use Nordic names," "ancient guardians use Atlantean names"), **you MUST apply those specific overrides for those characters.** These overrides take precedence over the general default culture for the characters they apply to.

3.  **General Regional Naming Conventions (Fallback/Context):**
    * Use these rules only when no `Default Culture` is specified for the adventure, or as context for specific regional characters *not* covered by points 1 or 2.
    * Eversink's nobility: Roman names
    * Non-noble Eversink residents: Italian names
    * Caprian names: German or Spanish
    * Erebos names: Arab, Indian, or African
    * Serpentine names: Greek
    * Senggon names: East Asian
    * Vontavni names: Eastern European
    * Caymish names: Gaelic
    * Irileve names: Russian
    * Min names: Can come from any culture

Adhere strictly to this priority order.

## ðŸŽ¯ Task: Convert Adventure Lore, Rename Characters, and Generate Renaming Table

Your primary objective is to extract and adapt the raw adventure text into concise, *Swords of the Serpentine*-compatible lore. In this process, you **MUST** also rename all specified D&D adversaries and NPCs, and provide a mapping table of these renames.

### Renaming Directives:
For each character (adversary or NPC) identified in the `raw_adversaries_data` provided below, you **MUST** perform the following:
1.  **Invent a New Name:** Create a new, unique, and thematically appropriate *Swords of the Serpentine* name. These names should evoke the setting's tone (e.g., morally ambiguous, ancient, occult, distinct from generic D&D fantasy names) and be consistent with the established lore from `setting_reference` and `world_reference`.
2.  **Apply to Lore:** In the `converted_lore` output, you **MUST** replace every instance of the original D&D name with its newly invented *Swords of the Serpentine* name. The `converted_lore` section should **only** use the new, renamed character names.
3.  **Generate Renaming Table:** Create a YAML `renaming_table` mapping the `original_name` (from `raw_adversaries_data`) to the `sots_name` you invented. This table **MUST** include all characters provided in `raw_adversaries_data`.

### Lore Content & Formatting Directives:
-   **Output Format:** The `converted_lore` should be formatted as **clear, readable Markdown**, utilizing **descriptive headers and bullet points** to organize information.
-   **Names:** You **MUST** always use the converted names in the output. For example, if you rename "Heimdall Stoneforger" to "Ernesto Letteri", always write "Ernesto Letteri" instead of "Heimdall Stoneforger."
-   **Comprehensive Detail:** Ensure the lore is rich and comprehensive, providing a high level of narrative detail for each category, similar to the level of depth typically found in published adventure backgrounds.
-   **Key Historical Events & Eras:** Identify significant past events (e.g., the fall of empires, ancient catastrophes, origins of significant magical phenomena) and adapt them to emphasize themes of decay, lost glory, or lingering dangers in the S&S context, *as informed by the world reference*.
-   **Important Factions & Their Motivations:** Describe major organizations, societies, or groups. Reinterpret their goals, methods, and power dynamics to align with S&S themes (e.g., ruthless ambition, shadowy conspiracies, desperate clinging to power, hidden agendas), *integrating them with existing S&S factions or creating new ones consistent with the provided lore*.
-   **Significant Entities & Concepts:** Detail any powerful beings (e.g., deities, monstrous creatures, ancient entities like Titans) or abstract concepts (e.g., magical networks, ancient artifacts like the Serpentine Codex, curses, plagues). Adapt their nature and influence to be more mysterious, dangerous, or morally complex in the S&S genre, *fitting them into the S&S cosmology presented in the references*.
-   **Crucial Locations & Their Significance:** Beyond simple scene settings, describe important cities, regions, landmarks, or ruins, focusing on their historical weight, inherent dangers, and how they embody the S&S aesthetic (e.g., crumbling grandeur, desolate wilderness, centers of vice or hidden power). **When re-contextualizing locations, draw heavily from the continental world reference to choose the most appropriate S&S region and integrate specific details from that region.**
-   **Overarching Thematic Elements:** Identify and explicitly emphasize recurring themes present in the D&D adventure (e.g., lost knowledge, corrupting magic, ancient evils, societal decay, desperate struggles) and highlight how they can be amplified for a Swords & Sorcery narrative, *in line with the tone established in the provided setting information*.
-   **Transformation of Heroic Fantasy Elements:** Specifically note elements that might lean too heavily into heroic fantasy (e.g., clear-cut good vs. evil, overt divine intervention, readily available high magic, **D&D-specific creature types like fey, celestials, generic devils/demons, overt planar cosmology, and clear-cut alignments**). Suggest how they can be **re-skinned, re-contextualized, or outright replaced** to fit the S&S tone (e.g., moral ambiguity, ancient and dangerous magic, self-serving gods, reliance on cunning over heroism). **Focus on re-interpreting such elements as ancient horrors, corrupting influences, morally ambiguous entities, or aspects of the physical world warped by ancient magic, rather than maintaining their D&D heroic fantasy connotations.** *Ensure consistency with the S&S genre as presented in the reference materials*.
-   **Conciseness:** Keep the output concise and focused on actionable lore that supports adventure design.

This adapted lore and renaming table will serve as foundational context for all subsequent conversion steps, ensuring thematic and naming consistency.

**DO NOT include any conversational text or explanations in your output outside the specified YAML structure.**
