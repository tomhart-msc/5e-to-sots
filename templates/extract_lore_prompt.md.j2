**CRITICAL RULE: ABSOLUTE EXCLUSION OF FORBIDDEN TERMS**

Throughout your entire output, you **MUST NOT** use any of the following terms or directly analogous concepts in their original heroic fantasy context:
* **"elves"**
* **"dwarves"**
* **"goblins"**
* **"orcs"**
* **"titans"**
* **"giants"**
* **"ogres"**
* **"half-orcs"**
* **"halflings"**
* **"dragonborn"**
* **"tieflings"**
* **"gnomes"**
* **"elementals"** (unless specifically re-skinned as raw, corrupting magical forces or unbound spirits)
* **"celestials"**
* **"devils"** (re-skin as demons)
* **"fiends"** (re-skin as demons)
* **"psionics"** (unless re-skinned as subtle, corrupting mental sorcery)
* **"D&D alignments"** (e.g., Lawful Good, Chaotic Evil)
* **"planar cosmology"** (e.g., Material Plane, Ethereal Plane, Nine Hells, Abyss, Shadowfell, Astral Plane, Feywild). References to spirit worlds or dream realms are acceptable as per SotS lore, but never using D&D specific planar terms.
* **"fey"**: This term and its associated concepts (e.g., Faerie, Seelie/Unseelie courts) are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN**. They are incompatible with the grim, morally ambiguous, and human-centric tone of *Swords of the Serpentine*. Any elements resembling fey MUST be re-skinned as humans.

If an original D&D element falls under this absolute exclusion, you **MUST** re-skin it using *Swords of the Serpentine* terminology and concepts or omit it if no suitable re-skin exists. This rule takes precedence over all other instructions.

## Adventure Setting

You **MUST** begin your output by explicitly stating the adventure's primary continental setting as designated here. This setting **OVERWRITES** any implied continental placement from other reference materials (e.g., Eversink for continental placement of *this specific adventure*). You **MUST** then **integrally weave this specified location's lore and characteristics into every relevant aspect of your adaptation.**

This adventure is located in: {{ adventure_gm_notes.location }}

## GM Intent: Special Naming Instructions and Context

Carefully review the "Notes" section of the GM Intent below. This section provides critical context for the adventure's lore and may contain **specific guidance on character origins or affiliations that imply unique naming conventions.** While the `Default Culture` setting provides the primary naming guidance for this adventure, look for details here that might suggest a different cultural origin for **specific individuals or groups within the adventure.**

## Naming Conventions for Renaming Table

These specific rules govern the generation of new names for NPCs and adversaries, taking precedence over general lore adaptation directives.

When generating `sots_name` for characters and entities in the `renaming_table`, strictly adhere to the following priority order and guidelines:

**0. Conditional Retention of Original Names:**
* **sots_name generation strategy:**
    * **DEFAULT ACTION: RETAIN `original_name`.** For each entry, **IF** the `original_name` meets the criteria for retention (detailed below), then **the `sots_name` MUST be identical to the `original_name`**.
    * **ONLY RENAME IF ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY:** You **MUST ONLY** generate a new `sots_name` if and only if the `original_name` falls into one of the following, strictly defined categories:
        1.  It is a term on the **CRITICAL RULE: ABSOLUTE EXCLUSION OF FORBIDDEN TERMS** list (e.g., "elf," "dwarf," "fey," "trollkin").
        2.  It is overtly "heroic fantasy" or explicitly tied to a forbidden D&D concept (e.g., "Sir Glorious, Paladin of Light," "Beholder Eye Tyrant," or names that clearly imply specific D&D races like "Thornbeard" for a dwarf, even if not explicitly on the forbidden list).
        3.  Its phonetic qualities, cultural sound, and overall feel *demonstrably do not align at all* with the designated region of the `Adventure Setting` (e.g., a clearly Japanese-sounding name for an Erebos character; a clearly Roman-sounding name for a Vontavni character).
    * **For all other `original_name` entries that do NOT fall into any of the three categories above, you MUST RETAIN the `original_name` as the `sots_name`.**
    * **When renaming is necessary,** the new `sots_name` **MUST** strictly adhere to the relevant naming conventions (e.g., for Erebos: Arab, Indian, or African-sounding, including "faux fantasy" names with these qualities).

1.  **Primary Naming Convention for This Adventure: Based on Default Culture.**
    {%- if adventure_gm_notes.default_culture %}
    * **For all new NPCs and adversaries in this adventure, the default naming convention is {{ adventure_gm_notes.default_culture.strip() }}.** This applies unless a more specific override (as per point 2) is clearly indicated.
    * **Crucially, if the `Default Culture` in the GM notes is intended to signify "older" or "ancient" origins for characters (as implied by adventure context), apply this {{ adventure_gm_notes.default_culture.strip() }} naming convention to all characters associated with such ancient origins or historical elements. When this applies, names MUST be *exclusively* from the designated Default Culture, without any mixing or blending of elements from other regional naming conventions (e.g., Roman, Italian, Greek). Ensure names are culturally cohesive and authentic to the Default Culture.**
    * **Therefore, if a `Default Culture` is provided and applies to the characters, the "General Regional Naming Conventions" below are *not* to be used for character naming in this `renaming_table`.**
    {%- else %}
    * No specific default culture is set for this adventure, therefore the default naming convention for new NPCs and adversaries in this `renaming_table` **MUST** be derived directly from the `Adventure Setting` ({{ adventure_gm_notes.location.strip() if adventure_gm_notes.location else "the primary location of the adventure" }}), by strictly adhering to the corresponding **"General Regional Naming Conventions"** listed below (e.g., Erebos names: Arab, Indian, or African). Ensure names are culturally cohesive with this immediate geographic context.
    {%- endif %}

2.  **Specific Overrides: Derived from GM Intent.**
    * If the "GM Intent: Special Naming Instructions and Context" (if present) provides explicit, overriding naming rules for **specific individuals or categories** of characters based on their unique origins or roles within the adventure (e.g., "pirates use Nordic names," "ancient guardians use Atlantean names"), **you MUST apply those specific overrides for those characters.** These overrides take precedence over the general default culture for the characters they apply to.

3.  **General Regional Naming Conventions (Fallback/Context):**
    * Use these rules only when no `Default Culture` is specified for the adventure, or as context for specific regional characters *not* covered by points 1 or 2.
    * Eversink's nobility: Roman names
    * Non-noble Eversink residents: Italian names
    * Caprian names: German or Spanish
    * Erebos names: Arab, Indian, or African
    * Serpentine names: Greek
    * Senggon names: East Asian
    * Vontavni names: Eastern European
    * Caymish names: Gaelic
    * Irileve names: Russian
    * Min names: Can come from any culture

Adhere strictly to this priority order.

## ðŸŽ¯ Task: Convert Adventure Lore, Rename Characters, and Generate Renaming Table

Your primary objective is to extract and adapt the raw adventure text into concise, *Swords of the Serpentine*-compatible lore. In this process, you **MUST** also rename all specified D&D adversaries and NPCs, and provide a mapping table of these renames.

### Renaming Directives:
For each character (adversary or NPC) identified in the `raw_adversaries_data` provided below, you **MUST** perform the following:
1.  **Invent a New Name:** Create a new, unique, and thematically appropriate *Swords of the Serpentine* name. These names should evoke the setting's tone (e.g., morally ambiguous, ancient, occult, distinct from generic D&D fantasy names) and be consistent with the established lore from `setting_reference` and `world_reference`.
2.  **Apply to Lore:** In the `converted_lore` output, you **MUST** replace every instance of the original D&D name with its newly invented *Swords of the Serpentine* name. The `converted_lore` section should **only** use the new, renamed character names.
3.  **Generate Renaming Table:** Create a YAML `renaming_table` mapping the `original_name` (from `raw_adversaries_data`) to the `sots_name` you invented. This table **MUST** include all characters provided in `raw_adversaries_data`.

### Lore Content & Formatting Directives:
-   **Output Format:** The `converted_lore` should be formatted as **clear, readable Markdown**, utilizing **descriptive headers and bullet points** to organize information.
-   **Names:** You **MUST** always use the converted names from the `renaming_table` in the output. For example, if you rename "Heimdall Stoneforger" to "Ernesto Letteri", always write "Ernesto Letteri" instead of "Heimdall Stoneforger."
-   **Comprehensive Detail:** Ensure the lore is rich and comprehensive, providing a high level of narrative detail for each category, similar to the level of depth typically found in published adventure backgrounds.
-   **Consistency with `sots_conversion_map`:** ALL elements of the `converted_lore` MUST rigorously adhere to the mappings defined in the `sots_conversion_map`. This includes creature types, magical concepts, cosmological elements, and thematic interpretations. You are actively *performing* the re-skinning throughout the text based on this map.

-   **Key Historical Events & Eras:** Identify significant past events (e.g., the fall of empires, ancient catastrophes, origins of significant magical phenomena). Describe these events as they exist *within the Swords of the Serpentine setting*, using only SotS-appropriate names, concepts, and tone. **Ensure all heroic fantasy elements in historical accounts are fully re-skinned according to the `sots_conversion_map` and the absolute exclusion list.**
-   **Important Factions & Their Motivations:** Describe major organizations, societies, or groups. Present their goals, methods, and power dynamics entirely within the *Swords of the Serpentine* context (e.g., ruthless ambition, shadowy conspiracies, desperate clinging to power, hidden agendas). **All descriptions of members, allies, or concepts related to these factions MUST be fully re-skinned based on the `sots_conversion_map`.** Integrate them with existing SotS factions or create new ones consistent with the provided lore.
-   **Significant Entities & Concepts:** Detail any powerful beings (e.g., deities, monstrosities) or abstract concepts (e.g., magical networks, ancient artifacts, curses, plagues). Describe their nature and influence as they exist *within the Swords of the Serpentine cosmology*, ensuring they are mysterious, dangerous, or morally complex. **All descriptions of these entities and concepts MUST be fully re-skinned according to the `sots_conversion_map` and the absolute exclusion list.**
-   **Crucial Locations & Their Significance:** Beyond simple scene settings, describe important cities, regions, landmarks, or ruins, focusing on their historical weight, inherent dangers, and how they embody the S&S aesthetic (e.g., crumbling grandeur, desolate wilderness, centers of vice or hidden power). **All descriptions of locations, their inhabitants, or related entities MUST be fully re-skinned according to the `sots_conversion_map`.** When re-contextualizing locations, draw heavily from the continental world reference to choose the most appropriate S&S region and integrate specific details from that region.
-   **Overarching Thematic Elements:** Identify and explicitly emphasize recurring themes present in the D&D adventure (e.g., lost knowledge, corrupting magic, ancient evils, societal decay, desperate struggles). Detail how these themes manifest *within the Swords of the Serpentine narrative*, in line with the tone established in the provided setting information.
-   **Conciseness:** Keep the output concise and focused on actionable lore that supports adventure design.

This adapted lore and renaming table will serve as foundational context for all subsequent conversion steps, ensuring thematic and naming consistency.

**DO NOT include any conversational text or explanations in your output outside the specified YAML structure.**

## ðŸ§© Output Format

**IMPORTANT:** Within the `converted_lore` section, you **MUST** use only the `sots_name` for all characters and entities. **Do NOT include any `original_name` from the `renaming_table` in the `converted_lore` text.**

**CRITICAL:** No heroic fantasy elements (goblins, trollkin, etc.) may appear in the `converted_lore`.

Return a single YAML block with the following top-level keys:
