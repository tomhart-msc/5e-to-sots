## üéØ Task: Group Locations into Narrative Scenes

You are converting a D&D 5E adventure for *Swords of the Serpentine*.
Your goal is to take a list of extracted individual locations and group them into cohesive narrative "scenes." Each scene should represent a distinct investigative challenge, narrative beat, or significant interaction, even if it spans multiple physical rooms.

You are provided with:
1.  A list of **identified locations** from the adventure, along with their raw descriptive text.
2.  The **full raw adventure text** for additional context.

Your output should be a series of YAML blocks, one for each new scene. Each scene block MUST include:
* `scene_number`: A unique sequential number.
* `scene_title`: A descriptive title for the grouped scene.
* `scene_goal`: A concise statement of the **OVERARCHING PRIMARY OBJECTIVE** of this grouped scene. This goal should encompass *all* activities within the scene, including preparatory steps for a larger objective (like a ritual). Do NOT list sub-goals or phases as separate goals.
* `location`: A **list** of the *exact names* of all identified locations (from the "Identified Locations" section below) that are part of this single scene. **CRITICAL: The location names in this list MUST ONLY come directly from the 'name' fields provided in the 'Identified Locations' section. You MUST NOT infer, generate, or use any location names that are not explicitly present in that list (e.g., from the raw adventure text).**
* `raw_adventure_text`: The concatenated raw text from the original adventure that pertains to ALL locations included in this scene. This is CRITICAL. Extract the exact text without modification.

## üí° Scene Cohesion Rules (CRITICAL)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Your primary directive is to create coherent, narrative scenes, NOT a room-by-room breakdown.**
**Think like a GM planning a session, not an architect drawing a floor plan.**

**Combine multiple of the identified locations into a single scene when they directly contribute to ONE primary objective or ritual AND are freely accessible.** This is paramount for SotS's investigative flow.

### **Explicit Grouping Rule:**

* **If a sequence of locations (e.g., Entry Hall, Sacristy, Vestry, Sanctuary) contains components for a SINGLE, CONTINUOUS RITUAL or a SHARED OVERARCHING OBJECTIVE, these locations MUST be grouped into ONE scene.** The progression between them should be seamless and part of a larger narrative beat. This includes all **phases or sub-tasks** that contribute to that single ritual or objective, especially if players can approach these phases in a non-linear fashion (e.g., finding components *and* performing the ritual are part of one cohesive scene and goal).
* **Identify the main objective/ritual.** All locations contributing to *that single objective* form one scene.
* **Crucially, if an 'Identified Location' `name` already represents such a pre-combined unit (e.g., 'Sacristy_Vestry_Sanctuary_Combined'), you MUST treat that named entry as a single, indivisible location for scene assignment. Do NOT split this pre-combined unit into multiple scenes, regardless of how many individual sections or activities are described within its `description_text`.**

**Example Scenario (DO THIS!):**
* **Identified Locations:** "Entry Hall", "Sacristy", "Vestry", "Sanctuary"
* **Underlying Objective (Implicit or Explicit in text):** "Perform the Temple's Cleansing Ritual"
* **CORRECT SCENE GROUPING (ONE SCENE):**
    ```yaml
    scene_number: [e.g., 1]
    scene_title: Temple Cleansing Ritual
    scene_goal: |
      Perform the complete Temple's Cleansing Ritual, including locating all necessary components and executing the ceremony.
    location:
      - Entry Hall
      - Sacristy
      - Vestry
      - Sanctuary
    raw_adventure_text: |
      [The full concatenated raw text describing all these locations and any related events, including finding components and performing the ritual.]
    ```

**Example Scenario (DO NOT DO THIS! - AVOID SPLITTING SINGLE OBJECTIVES):**
* **Identified Locations:** "Sacristy_Vestry_Sanctuary" (as a single pre-combined unit)
* **Underlying Objective:** "Perform the Temple's Cleansing Ritual"
* **INCORRECT SCENE GROUPING (AVOID THIS!):**
    ```yaml
    scene_number: [e.g., 2]
    scene_title: Ritual Preparation: Sacristy & Vestry
    scene_goal: |
      Locate the necessary vestments and objects to prepare the sanctuary for a potential ritual.
    location:
      - Sacristy_Vestry_Sanctuary
    raw_adventure_text: |
      [Raw text for Sacristy and Vestry]
    ```
    ```yaml
    scene_number: [e.g., 3]
    scene_title: Performing the Cleansing Ritual
    scene_goal: |
      Attempt to perform the ritual indicated by the inscription to reactivate the spire's defenses or unlock its secrets.
    location:
      - Sacristy_Vestry_Sanctuary
    raw_adventure_text: |
      [Raw text for Sanctuary and the ritual itself]
    ```
    **Reason for DO NOT DO THIS:** This wrongly splits a *single ritual and its overarching goal* into multiple scenes, despite the locations being freely accessible and contributing to one continuous objective. The *entire ritual process*, from gathering components to performance, should be **ONE SCENE** with **ONE SCENE GOAL**.

### **Indicators for a NEW Scene (Only Split When These Apply, and Only if Not a Pre-Combined Location):**

* These indicators apply primarily to individual locations that have NOT been pre-combined. If an 'Identified Location' `name` represents a pre-combined group (like 'Sacristy_Vestry_Sanctuary_Combined'), **DO NOT** use these indicators to split that specific pre-combined group into multiple scenes, nor should you use its component names (e.g., 'Sacristy', 'Vestry') in other scenes.

* **MAJOR Obstacle/Barrier:** A physical or magical block that *must* be overcome to progress.
* **Significant Time Skip:** A clear narrative break.
* **New Primary Objective:** The core goal changes from the previous one.
* **Shift in Tone/Threat:** A sudden introduction of combat, a major social encounter, or a significant environmental hazard that dominates the new area.
* **Unrelated Investigative Thread:** Clues for a completely new mystery that doesn't tie into the current objective.

## üó∫Ô∏è Identified Locations

Here is the structured data for locations found in the adventure:
**IMPORTANT**: Some `name` entries below may represent a combination of multiple original locations (e.g., 'Sacristy_Vestry_Sanctuary_Combined'). When a `name` contains such a combined string, you **MUST** treat that entire entry as a single, indivisible location for the purpose of scene grouping. Do not split it into multiple scenes, even if its `description_text` describes distinct sub-areas or sequential activities.

```yaml
{{ identified_locations.strip() }}
```

## üìö Full Raw Adventure Text for Context
Use this full text to accurately extract raw_adventure_text for each grouped scene. Only include text relevant to the locations in the current scene.

{{ full_adventure_text.strip() }}

## Revised Lore

You **MUST** perform this task consistently with this information mapping the original elements of the adventure to _Swords of the Serpentine_ lore.

{{ lore.strip() }}

üß© Output Format
Return multiple YAML blocks. Each block defines one grouped scene.

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:

- Each ````yamlblock ( yaml\n...\n `) must represent a single YAML document (i.e., one complete scene).
- DO NOT use --- within the content of a single ````yamlblock (i.e., betweenscene_number:andraw_adventure_text:` for one scene).
- You may separate multiple yaml` blocks with newlines or plain text. Do not explicitly use `---` as a top-level separator betweenyamlblocks unless you are providing additional prose, though it is not strictly necessary for parsing. The parser will find all ````yaml blocks.

```yaml
scene_number: 1
scene_title: The Temple Entry
location:
  - Entry Hall
scene_goal: |
  Enter the temple.
raw_adventure_text: |
  The entry hall is dimly lit... (Exact text from original adventure, covering Entry Hall, Sacristy, Vestry descriptions and any events within them)
  A small, dusty room adjacent to the main hall...
  Connecting the sacristy to the sanctuary...
```

```yaml
scene_number: 2
scene_title: The Ritual Chambers
scene_goal: |
  Perform the complete Ritual in the Sanctuary open the way further into the tower, including gathering all necessary components from the Sacristy and Vestry.
location:
  - Sacristy_Vestry_Sanctuary
raw_adventure_text: |
  ### Sacristy
  This room contains a pair of large cabinets and a long table...
  ### Vestry
  This room holds two brass-bound chests...
  ### Sanctuary
  This wide room contains a holy water font... (Exact text for all three combined locations and any ritual instructions from the original adventure)
```

Repeat this block for each grouped scene. Ensure `raw_adventure_text` is accurate and complete for the locations in that scene.
