# ‚öîÔ∏è Swords of the Serpentine ‚Äî Rules System Reference (for Adventure Conversion)

This document guides language models converting fantasy adventures (e.g. D&D) into *Swords of the Serpentine* (SotS). It includes system mechanics, ability usage, and scene design rules based on the GUMSHOE engine.

---

## 1. üéØ System Summary

*Swords of the Serpentine* (SotS) is a narrative sword & sorcery RPG built on the GUMSHOE engine. Clue discovery is automatic with the right abilities. Players roll only when outcomes are uncertain and dramatic. Investigative abilities always succeed ‚Äî they‚Äôre not rolled. General abilities are used for risk-based action resolution.

Combat is cinematic but not central. Adventures emphasize social leverage, ancient secrets, faction politics, and moral ambiguity. Magic (Sorcery) is powerful but always tied to corruption.

---

## 2. üß≠ Core Rules Overview

- **Clues are never gated** behind rolls or arbitrary narration.
- **Investigative abilities auto-succeed** if used in the right context.
- **General abilities are rolled** only when success is uncertain and failure is meaningful.
- **Scene design** must include Core Leads (essential clues) and optional avenues (choices, alternate paths, complications).

Clarification on Corruption: Use the Corruption investigative ability when:
- The environment has been reshaped by sorcery
- Reality feels subtly off (e.g. time, geometry, perception)
- An object or ritual might have arcane power or origin
- People behave strangely due to magical influence
Do *not* confuse Corruption with evil, greed, or desecration. In SotS, Corruption refers to arcane intrusion into the world ‚Äî a metaphysical warping that marks the presence of power.

---

## 5. üî• Corruption & Sorcery

- You cannot take Sorcery without at least 1 rank in **Corruption**.
- Each Corruption rank grants access to a **Sorcerous Sphere** (e.g. Coin, Fear, Fire).
- Corruption comes in two forms:
  - **Internalized**: You physically or mentally mutate.
  - **Externalized**: Your environment becomes warped or haunted.
- Sorcery is powered by Corruption. Using it leaves narrative and mechanical traces.
- Sorcerers are feared and usually act in secret.

Clarification: "Corruption" is not a moral judgment.
It does not detect sinful behavior or emotional weakness. Instead, it identifies how sorcery has transformed people, places, or reality.
A sanctified altar desecrated by greed is not corrupt.
A sanctified altar now weeping mercury because it was used in a blood-ritual is.

---

## 6. üß© Scene Design for LLM Conversion

> When converting scenes, apply the following design guidelines.

- **Every scene must include at least one Core Lead** discoverable via Investigative abilities.
- Leads are tied to a specific ability (e.g., *Forgotten Lore*, *City‚Äôs Secrets*).
- **No rolling for clues.** If a character has the ability and context, they get the clue.
- Include optional General ability challenges (with TNs) when tension or risk matters.
- Clues should often introduce faction ties, ancient history, or secrets worth killing for.

## 7. üåÄ Maneuvers

Maneuvers are special combat actions that create tactical or narrative advantages. They are distinct from direct attacks (Warfare, Sorcery, Sway) and do not deal Health or Morale damage.

- Resolved with a General Ability test (usually **TN 4‚Äì6**).
- Do **not** apply a damage modifier.
- Use to **change the battlefield**, control enemies, or open new options.

### Common Maneuvers

| Maneuver         | Typical Ability | Description |
|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Daze**         | Sway, Tactics     | Temporarily stuns or distracts an enemy. |
| **Disarm**       | Warfare, Athletics | Knocks a weapon or item free. |
| **Grapple**      | Athletics         | Restrains or pins a foe. |
| **Trip/Knockdown** | Athletics       | Knocks an enemy off balance. |
| **Shove**        | Athletics         | Pushes an enemy physically. |
| **Feint**        | Warfare, Sway     | Tricks a foe into reacting to a false threat. |
| **Bluff**        | Sway              | Provokes fear, hesitation, or retreat. |
| **Expose Weakness** | Warfare, Vigilance | Reveals a tactical or emotional flaw. |

### Guidelines for Writers

- Always include:
  - The ability used (e.g., Athletics)
  - The TN (e.g., TN 5)
  - The effect of success (e.g., "target is knocked prone") and failure (e.g., "the attacker overextends")
- Use in place of brute-force combat to reflect cunning and control.

## 8. ‚ö†Ô∏è Traps

Traps are dramatic environmental dangers that tie into story and theme. They must be detectable, interpretable, and often narratively meaningful.

- Traps are not random: clues should exist to **warn players**.
- Investigative Abilities like *Felonious Intent*, *Spot Frailty*, or *Forgotten Lore* can reveal or interpret them.
- General Abilities like *Burglary*, *Athletics*, or *Tactics* are used to bypass or disable them.

### Trap Template

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Detection Clue** | What reveals the trap (e.g., "Vigilance: A scuff mark on the tiles hints at movement.") |
| **Disarm Ability** | General Ability and TN (e.g., Burglary TN 5) |
| **Triggered Effect** | Health or Morale damage, corruption effects, imprisonment, etc. |
| **Narrative Clue** | Optional: origin, symbolic meaning, or faction connection. |

### Trap Design Principles

- Traps should **reward attention to detail**.
- Magical traps often have a **signature**, especially if tied to a Sphere.
- Traps can provoke investigation, fear, or lateral thinking ‚Äî not just damage.

### Example Traps

#### **Glyph of Unwelcome Memory**
- **Detection**: Forgotten Lore ‚Äî The dust forms unnatural glyphs of the old Serpentine Empire.
- **Disarm**: Sorcery (Memory) TN 6
- **Effect if Triggered**: A pulse of magical dread. All who see it suffer 2 Morale damage and forget the last 10 minutes.
- **Narrative Hook**: These glyphs were favored by the Coil of Memory to erase witnesses.

---

#### **Flesh-Cutter Thread**
- **Detection**: Vigilance ‚Äî A faint shimmer across the threshold.
- **Disarm**: Burglary TN 5
- **Effect if Triggered**: Razorwire snaps free, dealing 2 Health damage to the first person through.
- **Narrative Hook**: A signature of the Vontavni death cults. Usually rigged in pairs.

---

#### **Collapsing Statue Mechanism**
- **Detection**: Spot Frailty ‚Äî The base of a marble statue has cracked from underneath.
- **Disarm**: Tactics TN 4
- **Effect if Triggered**: The statue falls (or explodes), dealing 1 Health and pinning a Hero until freed.
- **Narrative Hook**: Common in Denari temples repurposed by heretics.

---

## 9. üß© Core vs Optional Leads

In Swords of the Serpentine, clues discovered with Investigative abilities are either **Core Leads** or **Optional Leads**.

### Core Leads
- **Must be found** to move the adventure forward.
- They advance the plot, connect scenes, or reveal critical information.
- Core Leads are **automatically discovered** if the relevant Investigative ability is used in the right place.
- They are **never gated** behind die rolls.

> üõ† Example: Forgotten Lore (Core Lead) ‚Äì "The ancient sigil carved into the well reveals this tomb belonged to a heretical priest exiled from Eversink. This connects to Scene 4, where his surviving cult gathers."

### Optional Leads
- Offer **useful but non-essential** information.
- Provide tactical advantages, foreshadowing, treasure, or deeper lore.
- Help players feel rewarded for thorough investigation.
- May add **layers of understanding**, emotional weight, or misdirection.

> üõ† Example: Vigilance (Optional Lead) ‚Äì "A small statue of Denari is tucked into a hidden wall niche. Scratched into the base is a phrase also used by the merchant in Scene 2."

### Writing Guidance
- Every scene should include:
  - At least **one Core Lead**
  - Several **Optional Leads** (2‚Äì4 is typical)
- Always state which Investigative ability uncovers each clue.
- Clues should feel **interpretive**, not just expository ‚Äî they give **pieces** of the puzzle, not full answers.
