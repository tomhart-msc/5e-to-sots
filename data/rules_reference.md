# ⚔️ Swords of the Serpentine — Rules System Reference (for Adventure Conversion)

This document guides language models converting fantasy adventures (e.g. D&D) into *Swords of the Serpentine* (SotS). It includes system mechanics, ability usage, and scene design rules based on the GUMSHOE engine.

---

## 1. 🎯 System Summary

*Swords of the Serpentine* (SotS) is a narrative sword & sorcery RPG built on the GUMSHOE engine. Clue discovery is automatic with the right abilities. Players roll only when outcomes are uncertain and dramatic. Investigative abilities always succeed — they’re not rolled. General abilities are used for risk-based action resolution.

Combat is cinematic but not central. Adventures emphasize social leverage, ancient secrets, faction politics, and moral ambiguity. Magic (Sorcery) is powerful but always tied to corruption.

## 5. 🔥 Corruption & Sorcery

- You cannot take Sorcery without at least 1 rank in **Corruption**.
- Each Corruption rank grants access to a **Sorcerous Sphere** (e.g. Coin, Fear, Fire).
- Corruption comes in two forms:
  - **Internalized**: You physically or mentally mutate.
  - **Externalized**: Your environment becomes warped or haunted.
- Sorcery is powered by Corruption. Using it leaves narrative and mechanical traces.
- Sorcerers are feared and usually act in secret.

---

## 6. 🧩 Scene Design for LLM Conversion

> When converting scenes, apply the following design guidelines.

- **Every scene must include at least one Core Lead** discoverable via Investigative abilities.
- Leads are tied to a specific ability (e.g., *Forgotten Lore*, *City’s Secrets*).
- **No rolling for clues.** If a character has the ability and context, they get the clue.
- Include optional General ability challenges (with TNs) when tension or risk matters.
- Clues should often introduce faction ties, ancient history, or secrets worth killing for.
