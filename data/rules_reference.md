# ⚔️ Swords of the Serpentine — Rules System Reference (for Adventure Conversion)

This document guides language models converting fantasy adventures (e.g. D&D) into *Swords of the Serpentine* (SotS). It includes system mechanics, ability usage, and scene design rules based on the GUMSHOE engine.

---

## 1. 🎯 System Summary

*Swords of the Serpentine* (SotS) is a narrative sword & sorcery RPG built on the GUMSHOE engine. Clue discovery is automatic with the right abilities. Players roll only when outcomes are uncertain and dramatic. Investigative abilities always succeed — they’re not rolled. General abilities are used for risk-based action resolution.

Combat is cinematic but not central. Adventures emphasize social leverage, ancient secrets, faction politics, and moral ambiguity. Magic (Sorcery) is powerful but always tied to corruption.

## 2. 🧭 Core Rules Overview

- **Clues are never gated** behind rolls or arbitrary narration.
- **Investigative abilities auto-succeed** if used in the right context.
- **General abilities are rolled** only when success is uncertain and failure is meaningful.
- **Scene design** must include Core Leads (essential clues) and optional avenues (choices, alternate paths, complications).

---

## 3. 🧠 Investigative Abilities

> Investigative abilities are used to discover information. They are never rolled. They always succeed when relevant.

- **Vigilance** – Notice small, critical details.  
  *“The ink on this scroll is still drying.”*

### 🔮 Sorcerer Abilities
- **Corruption** – Reveals the presence and consequences of sorcery or unnatural influence. It does not indicate moral evil or physical decay — it identifies how magic has altered the world, even subtly.
  *“These wards were written in blood and hate.”*
- **Forgotten Lore** – Identify ancient or mythic references.  
  *“The idol is pre-Serpentine — long before Denari.”*
- **Leechcraft** – Know wounds, poison, healing.

### 🐍 Thief Abilities

  *“Your boot catches on a loose cobblestone… that reveals a secret door.”*
- **Scurrilous Rumors** – Recall gossip, scandal, innuendo.  
  *“They say she was seen near the flooded quarter — twice.”*
- **Skulduggery** – Gather secrets via espionage, shadowing.  
  *“You lift a note from his pocket: it’s written in cipher.”*

Clarification on Corruption: Use the Corruption investigative ability when:
- The environment has been reshaped by sorcery
- Reality feels subtly off (e.g. time, geometry, perception)
- An object or ritual might have arcane power or origin
- People behave strangely due to magical influence
Do *not* confuse Corruption with evil, greed, or desecration. In SotS, Corruption refers to arcane intrusion into the world — a metaphysical warping that marks the presence of power.

### 📜 Abilities List

## 5. 🔥 Corruption & Sorcery

- You cannot take Sorcery without at least 1 rank in **Corruption**.
- Each Corruption rank grants access to a **Sorcerous Sphere** (e.g. Coin, Fear, Fire).
- Corruption comes in two forms:
  - **Internalized**: You physically or mentally mutate.
  - **Externalized**: Your environment becomes warped or haunted.
- Sorcery is powered by Corruption. Using it leaves narrative and mechanical traces.
- Sorcerers are feared and usually act in secret.

Clarification: "Corruption" is not a moral judgment.
It does not detect sinful behavior or emotional weakness. Instead, it identifies how sorcery has transformed people, places, or reality.
A sanctified altar desecrated by greed is not corrupt.
A sanctified altar now weeping mercury because it was used in a blood-ritual is.

## 6. 🧩 Scene Design for LLM Conversion

> When converting scenes, apply the following design guidelines.

- **Every scene must include at least one Core Lead** discoverable via Investigative abilities.
- Leads are tied to a specific ability (e.g., *Forgotten Lore*, *City’s Secrets*).
- **No rolling for clues.** If a character has the ability and context, they get the clue.
- Include optional General ability challenges (with TNs) when tension or risk matters.
- Clues should often introduce faction ties, ancient history, or secrets worth killing for.

## 7. 🌀 Maneuvers

Maneuvers are special combat actions that create tactical or narrative advantages. They are distinct from direct attacks (Warfare, Sorcery, Sway) and do not deal Health or Morale damage.

- Resolved with a General Ability test (usually **TN 4–6**).
- Do **not** apply a damage modifier.
- Use to **change the battlefield**, control enemies, or open new options.

### Common Maneuvers

| Maneuver         | Typical Ability | Description |
|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Daze**         | Sway, Tactics     | Temporarily stuns or distracts an enemy. |
| **Disarm**       | Warfare, Athletics | Knocks a weapon or item free. |
| **Grapple**      | Athletics         | Restrains or pins a foe. |
| **Trip/Knockdown** | Athletics       | Knocks an enemy off balance. |
| **Shove**        | Athletics         | Pushes an enemy physically. |
| **Feint**        | Warfare, Sway     | Tricks a foe into reacting to a false threat. |
| **Bluff**        | Sway              | Provokes fear, hesitation, or retreat. |
| **Expose Weakness** | Warfare, Vigilance | Reveals a tactical or emotional flaw. |

### Guidelines for Writers

- Always include:
  - The ability used (e.g., Athletics)
  - The TN (e.g., TN 5)
  - The effect of success (e.g., "target is knocked prone") and failure (e.g., "the attacker overextends")
- Use in place of brute-force combat to reflect cunning and control.

## 8. ⚠️ Traps

Traps are dramatic environmental dangers that tie into story and theme. They must be detectable, interpretable, and often narratively meaningful.

- Traps are not random: clues should exist to **warn players**.
- Investigative Abilities like *Felonious Intent*, *Spot Frailty*, or *Forgotten Lore* can reveal or interpret them.
- General Abilities like *Burglary*, *Athletics*, or *Tactics* are used to bypass or disable them.

### Trap Template

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Detection Clue** | What reveals the trap (e.g., "Vigilance: A scuff mark on the tiles hints at movement.") |
| **Disarm Ability** | General Ability and TN (e.g., Burglary TN 5) |
| **Triggered Effect** | Health or Morale damage, corruption effects, imprisonment, etc. |
| **Narrative Clue** | Optional: origin, symbolic meaning, or faction connection. |

### Trap Design Principles

- Traps should **reward attention to detail**.
- Magical traps often have a **signature**, especially if tied to a Sphere.
- Traps can provoke investigation, fear, or lateral thinking — not just damage.

### Example Traps

#### **Glyph of Unwelcome Memory**
- **Detection**: Forgotten Lore — The dust forms unnatural glyphs of the old Serpentine Empire.
- **Disarm**: Sorcery (Memory) TN 6
- **Effect if Triggered**: A pulse of magical dread. All who see it suffer 2 Morale damage and forget the last 10 minutes.
- **Narrative Hook**: These glyphs were favored by the Coil of Memory to erase witnesses.

---

#### **Flesh-Cutter Thread**
- **Detection**: Vigilance — A faint shimmer across the threshold.
- **Disarm**: Burglary TN 5
- **Effect if Triggered**: Razorwire snaps free, dealing 2 Health damage to the first person through.
- **Narrative Hook**: A signature of the Vontavni death cults. Usually rigged in pairs.

---

#### **Collapsing Statue Mechanism**
- **Detection**: Spot Frailty — The base of a marble statue has cracked from underneath.
- **Disarm**: Tactics TN 4
- **Effect if Triggered**: The statue falls (or explodes), dealing 1 Health and pinning a Hero until freed.
- **Narrative Hook**: Common in Denari temples repurposed by heretics.

---

## 9. 🧩 Core vs Optional Leads

In Swords of the Serpentine, clues discovered with Investigative abilities are either **Core Leads** or **Optional Leads**.

### Core Leads
- **Must be found** to move the adventure forward.
- They advance the plot, connect scenes, or reveal critical information.
- Core Leads are **automatically discovered** if the relevant Investigative ability is used in the right place.
- They are **never gated** behind die rolls.

> 🛠 Example: Forgotten Lore (Core Lead) – "The ancient sigil carved into the well reveals this tomb belonged to a heretical priest exiled from Eversink. This connects to Scene 4, where his surviving cult gathers."

### Optional Leads
- Offer **useful but non-essential** information.
- Provide tactical advantages, foreshadowing, treasure, or deeper lore.
- Help players feel rewarded for thorough investigation.
- May add **layers of understanding**, emotional weight, or misdirection.

> 🛠 Example: Vigilance (Optional Lead) – "A small statue of Denari is tucked into a hidden wall niche. Scratched into the base is a phrase also used by the merchant in Scene 2."

### Writing Guidance
- Every scene should include:
  - At least **one Core Lead**
  - Several **Optional Leads** (2–4 is typical)
- Always state which Investigative ability uncovers each clue.
- Clues should feel **interpretive**, not just expository — they give **pieces** of the puzzle, not full answers.
