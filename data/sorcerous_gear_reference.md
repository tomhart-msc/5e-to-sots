## Overview of Sorcerous Gear

Sorcerous Gear in *Swords of the Serpentine* is rare, powerful, and often deeply tied to Corruption. These items may
be grimoires, weapons, armor, trinkets, or other magical implements. Most cannot be purchased and must be found, gifted,
or stolen. They often have unique narrative effects and mechanical rules. Heroes generally carry only one or two of these
at most, and their use should feel impactful and thematic.

## ðŸ“– Grimoire Rules

Grimoires are rare, sentient books of ancient Sorcery. They are powerful, dangerous, and always require the Sorcerer to engage with the Corruption Investigative Ability to use them. Each grimoire is a unique, opinionated entity with its own agenda, voice, and rules of engagement.

### Grimoire Mechanics Summary

- **Corruption Requirement**: The bearer must have **at least 1 rank in Corruption** to use a grimoire.
- **Bonus Corruption Pool**: Grimoires grant **bonus Corruption points** that may only be used with their associated **Sorcerous Spheres**.
- **Sphere Limitation**: Each grimoire is tied to one or more specific **Spheres of Sorcery** (usually one per point granted). These spheres define what the grimoireâ€™s magic can affect.
- **Possession Risk**: The **first time** a grimoire is used each adventure, it typically attempts to **possess the Sorcerer** via a **Morale Maneuver** (Difficulty 6â€“8). Failure may result in **Morale damage** and **temporary loss of control**, during which the grimoire pursues its own agenda.
- **Personality & Communication**: Grimoires are **sentient** and communicate in unique ways (e.g., whispers, statue mouths, blood scrying). Their personalities shape the nature of their magic and consequences of misuse.
- **True Names & Secrets**: Some grimoires contain **True Names**, **forbidden knowledge**, or **unique spells** beyond the standard spheres.
- **Narrative Weight**: Grimoires should feel dangerous, ancient, and central to the plot. They often **whisper to other Sorcerers**, attract unwanted attention, or demand offerings.

## Mechanics Summary (Non-Grimoire Sorcerous Gear)

Non-grimoire Sorcerous Gear includes weapons, jewelry, relics, tokens, armor, or other unusual items infused with arcane power. These items are often unique, rarely for sale, and may be whimsical, dangerous, or unknowably ancient.

They typically do **not** require the bearer to have ranks in **Corruption**, making them usable by any archetype â€” including Warriors, Thieves, or Socialites.

### Common Mechanics and Traits

- **Item Slot**: Most items occupy a specific gear location (e.g., Primary Hand, Head, Off-Hand, Body).
- **Bonus Effects**: Items may grant:
  - **+1 Damage Modifiers**
  - **General Ability bonuses or new tricks**
  - Access to a narrow **Investigative ability effect**
  - **Maneuver bonuses**, typically to Bluff, Daze, Restrain, etc.
- **Limited Use**: Many activate only:
  - Once per **scene** or **adventure**
  - Under specific narrative conditions (e.g., only after a kill, only in moonlight)
- **Narrative Rules**: Items often carry narrative restrictions or side effects:
  - Compulsion to act a certain way
  - Emotional or social entanglements
  - Unusual costs (e.g., sacrifice, guilt, broken taboos)
- **No Sphere Access**: These items do **not** grant access to Sorcerous Spheres or bonus Corruption points.
- **No Possession Risk**: Unlike grimoires, these items do **not** attempt to control or overwhelm the bearer.

### Example Behaviors

- A dagger that reveals the future when used in a sacrifice.
- A ring that grants +1 to Command but makes you speak in prophecy.
- A charm that protects you from drowning, but attracts the attention of something ancient beneath the waves.

These items are often **cursed**, **temperamental**, or **symbolically meaningful**. Their effects should feel like dangerous tools, not game-breaking shortcuts.

## Design Notes

When converting D&D magic items:
- **Ignore numeric bonuses** like +1 weapons or AC.
- Focus on **fictional impact** and **mechanical equivalents** in SotS.
- Tie items to:
    * A Sorcerous Sphere (e.g., Death, Serpents, Ocean)
    * A narrative effect (e.g., possession, transformation, strange compulsion)
    * A specific bonus pool, resistance mechanic, or unique Maneuver effect

Use the examples above as templates to reinterpret D&D items. Even basic magical gear should **evoke flavor, power, and mystery**.
