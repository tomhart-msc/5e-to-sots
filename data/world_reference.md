# Swords of the Serpentine: Continental Reference

This document provides an overview of the world beyond Eversink, highlighting key regions, their characteristics, and potential adventure types. These descriptions lean towards classic tropes, offering easy hooks for campaigns set across the continent.

## The Great Kingdom of Capria

* **Core Archetype:** Classic, diverse fantasy nation on the brink of change. A realm of high and low nobles, political factions, and traditional knighthoods.
* **Description:** An old kingdom with rolling hills, ancient forests, and vast farmlands. It is a monarchy ruled by King Ceolwulf XIV from Torith. The realm is a patchwork of duchies, trade cities, and powerful consortiums. A rising urban class challenges the traditional noble hierarchy. People worship thousands of small, local gods.
* **Notable Locations:**
    * **Torith:** Capria's elegant and sprawling capital, a rival to Eversink in trade. Home to a sprawling university and library complex, known for its research capabilities and claims of tomes from the Serpentine Empire era. The city's council chafes under Kingdom rule, with disappearances among university staff hinting at royal agents.
    * **Hohenach:** A rough, dusty trade city on the far eastern border, at the foot of the Salt Mountains. It's a hub for trade with Erebos and mountain caravans, and home to alchemists blending Eastern and Western thought. Missionaries of the Fire God are active here, threatening to shift its allegiance towards Erebos.
* **Friends & Enemies:** Economic and political rivals with Eversink. Outwardly friendly with Theocracy of Erebos, but resent their missionary efforts. Actively tries to retake the Destroyed Plateaus to their north, though with heavy losses.
* **Adventure Hooks/Themes:**
    * **Political Intrigue:** Plotting nobles, succession crises, city-state rebellions.
    * **Academic & Ancient Mysteries:** Recovering lost knowledge from Torith's libraries, investigating disappearances, searching for artifacts of the Serpentine Empire.
    * **Border Conflicts & Exploration:** Expeditions into the dangerous Destroyed Plateaus.
    * **Religious & Cultural Clashes:** The rising influence of Erebos's Fire religion in border towns like Hohenach.
    * **Trade & Alchemy:** Smuggling, trade disputes, seeking rare reagents from the Salt Mountains for alchemists in Hohenach.

## Republic of Caym

* **Core Archetype:** Cold, hard lands of terrifying warriors with surprising steampunk technology. A fiercely independent state founded by exiles.
* **Description:** Located in the cold northern lands, characterized by wild interiors, active volcanoes, and an abundance of coal, iron, and caribou. Desperation has led to the development of steam technology, particularly in Cachain. Governed by a true parliamentary republic with a strong anti-authoritarian streak. The people are fierce, precise, methodical warriors and cunning accountants. They are proud of their origins as a penal colony.
* **Notable Locations:**
    * **Cachain:** The ancient capital, now an elegant city on the Serpent Sea. Steam technology is ubiquitous. It's a growing trade and banking hub, pioneering monetary innovations, and has a reputation for being run by criminals.
* **Friends & Enemies:** Rivals with Eversink, separated by the Serpent's Neck. Engaged in perpetual war with the Vontavni over control of the Serpent's Neck. Interested in using technology to reclaim the Destroyed Plateau.
* **Adventure Hooks/Themes:**
    * **Steampunk & Industrial Espionage:** Missions involving steam-powered devices, alchemical breakthroughs, and corporate/criminal rivalries in Cachain.
    * **Wilderness Survival & Monster Hunting:** Expeditions into the Caym interior, avoiding giants and other monsters, potentially involving volcanic regions.
    * **Political Intrigue & Revolutions:** Dealing with the volatile parliamentary system or challenges to local authority.
    * **Ancient Ruins & Reclamation:** Adventures tied to reclaiming parts of the former Serpentine Empire on the Destroyed Plateau using new technology.
    * **Organized Crime & Banking:** Navigating the criminal underworld and innovative (but potentially illicit) banking schemes in Cachain.

## The Vontavni Horse Lords and the Great Flatlands

* **Core Archetype:** Endless plains ruled by notoriously independent mounted troops. A nomadic, warring, herding, and trading society.
* **Description:** A grand prairie where one can ride for weeks without seeing another person. The Vontavni do not believe in material wealth and their armed horsemen are terrifying, known for overrunning cities. They have a poor memory of history but skilled prophets who see the future. Men and women are more equal than in other societies. Clans are the primary organizing influence, often feuding but uniting for war.
* **Notable Locations:**
    * **Yrans:** A haunted Sorcerer City ruled by a council of three immortal kings. Known for great sorcery, unsettling architecture, and academies of black magic and oily alchemy. Supplies horses to the Vontavni and produces fine leatherwork.
    * **The Tent City of Surharnil:** The mobile home of the Great Khathor. A city of a hundred thousand (or more) horse warriors that relocates with the seasons. It transforms into a giant, multi-year open-air marketplace and fair where goods from conquests are sold. Mercanti agents from Eversink visit to acquire unearthed gems.
* **Friends & Enemies:** Blood enemies with the Caym over control of the Serpent's Neck. Keen to destroy the Pirates of Min and their Witch-Queens.
* **Adventure Hooks/Themes:**
    * **Wilderness Expeditions & Nomadic Life:** Surviving the vast flatlands, engaging with Vontavni clans, trade caravans.
    * **Martial Prowess & Raids:** Participating in (or defending against) Vontavni raids, high-stakes combat on the plains.
    * **Prophecy & Ancient Sorcery:** Seeking out Vontavni prophets for glimpses of the future, or exploring the dark magic and unsettling secrets of Yrans.
    * **Diplomacy & Trade:** Navigating the complex social dynamics of the Vontavni clans, engaging in trade at Surharnil, or acting as intermediaries in clan feuds.
    * **Lost Knowledge & Ancient Secrets:** Yrans "remembers the Serpentine Empire well" and speaks of lost things being found again, making it a prime location for quests involving ancient lore like the "Serpentine Codex". This makes Yrans a strong candidate for a `Secrets of the Serpentine Scroll` type adventure, perhaps seeking a lost academy or forbidden knowledge within its unsettling architecture.

## Pirates of Min

* **Core Archetype:** Backbiting, suspicious, lawless pirates who effectively control the seas.
* **Description:** A loose confederation of pirate settlements, fishing villages, and flotillas along rocky coastlines and islands. Protected by treacherous crags. Min itself is a vast flotilla of sunken and floating naval craft. An autocratic government ruled by the most ruthless pirate, currently the ancient Witch-Queen and her storm sorceresses. A melting pot for exiles, criminals, and those fleeing the law.
* **Notable Locations:**
    * **Min (the city):** A chaotic maze of decks, broken ship interiors, hidden treasure rooms, and nighttime floating markets. Homes are built from driftwood and whale bone. Currently controlled by Pirate King Calhoun “Shifty” Xander.
* **Friends & Enemies:** No international friends. A thorn in Eversink's side. Hunted by Caprian patrols. Enemies with the Caym and constantly threatened by Vontavni raids. Useful as mercenaries and foils in proxy wars.
* **Adventure Hooks/Themes:**
    * **Piracy & Smuggling:** High-seas adventures, raids, inter-pirate conflicts, smuggling operations.
    * **Urban Underworld & Espionage:** Navigating the chaotic, criminal underworld of Min, dealing with mobsters and spies.
    * **Dark Sorcery & Tyranny:** Dealing with the terrifying magic and oppressive rule of the Witch-Queen, perhaps seeking to undermine her or escape her grasp.

    * **Naval Combat & Exploitation:** Sea battles, recovering lost cargo, dealing with forced impressment of crew.

## Theocracy of Erebos

* **Core Archetype:** A distant land of astonishing learning and culture, governed by an absolute theocracy of fire worship.
* **Description:** A far-off desert country east of the Salt Mountains. Known for gold, grapes, gems, red wine, and unusual weapons. Contradictory geography with dusty Salt Mountains to the west and a vast rainforest in the southeast. The God of Fire and Flame holds absolute power, with the Great Malik leading a complex religious hierarchy.
* **Adventure Hooks/Themes:**
    * **Religious & Cultic Intrigue:** Navigating the strict hierarchy of the Fire God's priests, uncovering heretical factions, or dealing with zealous missionaries.
    * **Desert Survival & Exploration:** Expeditions through the dusty Salt Mountains, which cough up metals and gems but are also dangerous.
    * **Jungle Exploration & Mythical Beasts:** Journeys into the vast rainforest, encountering exotic animals, mythical beasts, and desperate small gods. This aligns well with the "Olu Jungle" sections of your D&D adventure, making Erebos a strong candidate for re-skinning such locations.
    * **Forbidden Lore & Ancient Sites:** Seeking knowledge in the centers of learning, potentially uncovering secrets of the Fire God or ancient civilizations that existed before the theocracy. The mention of "astonishing learning and culture" combined with its ancient, desert setting, makes Erebos a prime location for adventures involving forgotten lore and powerful, dangerous magic, similar to the "Serpentine Codex" adventure.
    * **Alchemy & Exotic Reagents:** Acquiring rare components from the rainforest for powerful alchemical rituals.
    * **Political Tension:** Dealing with the Theocracy's expansionist tendencies and their influence on border towns like Hohenach.
