# 🏛️ Swords of the Serpentine — Setting Reference (Eversink & World Overview)

This is a system-neutral setting reference to guide the conversion of fantasy adventures to the world of *Swords of the Serpentine* (SotS), with an emphasis on tone, lore, and key locations.

---

## 🌍 The World

SotS is a sword & sorcery setting. Its tone is dark, political, and filled with ancient secrets. The setting evokes *Lankhmar*, *Ankh-Morpork*, and *Camorr* — not high fantasy.

- **No extant non-human civilizations.** All player characters and NPCs are human, though demons and monsters exist as rare threats.
- **Sorcery is rare, feared, and corrupting.** Sorcerers hide their power or face destruction.
- **Gods exist.** Most are minor, local, or symbolic — except for Denari.
- **Demons and spirits are real.** They exist in the spirit world and may be contacted, bargained with, or fought.
- **History is mutable.** Eversink has layers of forgotten history buried beneath it, but even recent “facts” may be lies or misremembered truths.

## 🏙️ Eversink: The City of Stories

Eversink is the default setting. It is a decadent, corrupt, beautiful trading city built on sinking islands in a river delta.

### Core Themes:
- **Everything is sinking** — literally. Buildings descend into the earth every year.
- **You live inside your Goddess.** Denari’s body *is* the city. Every coin exchanged is a prayer.
- **Statues house the dead.** Destroying a funerary statue risks releasing or destroying a soul.
- **Commerce is holy.** Profit equals virtue.
- **History is buried.** The past lies beneath the streets, often literally.

### Denari and the Church:
- Goddess of commerce, swans, and civilization.
- Signed the **Golden Contract**, promising protection for 1,000 years (pending renewal).
- Her blessing gives Eversink its prosperity.
- The Church owns vast swaths of the city and is politically dominant.
- Corruption (magical or moral) burns away her blessing.

---

## 🕯️ Culture & Society

- **Matriarchal tendencies.** Many organizations are women-led, including the Church.
- **Social class matters.** Gender, race, and orientation are broadly accepted; status and wealth define power.
- **Civic architecture is chaotic.** Cities grew without central planning, resulting in canals, mazes, and vertical shantytowns.
- **The city is overcrowded.** Homes extend up, down, and out. Streets are narrow and layered.
- **Land is scarce.** People live on rooftops, in sub-basements, or on boats.

---

## 🧱 Important Setting Mechanics

- **Funerary Statues:**  
  - Guarantee the dead a place in Denari’s heaven.  
  - Destroying one may return a ghost or obliterate a soul.  
  - True names inscribed on statues grant magic resistance and summoning potential.
  
- **Sinking Buildings:**  
  - Most buildings lose 8 cm a year.  
  - Older buildings extend deep underground.  
  - Flooded basements and hidden ruins are common — ideal for investigation scenes.

- **Divine Contract:**  
  - Eversink’s founding was a literal bargain with Denari.  
  - If all Golden Contract bloodlines die, the contract ends and Eversink is doomed.

## 🧙‍♂️ Factions (Power Groups)

Use these groups for intrigue, alliances, and opposition.

| Faction              | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Church of Denari** | Theocratic and powerful. Owns land. Combines bureaucracy and zeal. |
| **Ancient Nobility** | Descendants of Eversink’s founders. Elitist, inbred, and ritual-bound. |
| **Mercanti**         | Merchant families. Wealth = power. Manipulative, cutthroat. |
| **Outlanders**       | Foreigners and immigrants. Often discriminated against or scapegoated. |
| **City Watch**       | Overworked, corrupt, faction-controlled. |
| **Canal-Watchers & Architects’ Guild** | Maintain the infrastructure; know the city’s secrets. |
| **Guilds**           | Bakers, Spicers, Swineherds, and more — some petty, some dangerous. |
| **The Triskadane**   | 13 secret rulers chosen by Denari. Hidden identities. Ultimate power. |

---

## 🧚‍♀️ Magic, Spirits & Religion

- **Sorcery is always corrupting.** Practitioners are feared. The Church persecutes them.
- **Demons are real.** So are minor gods — each tied to a location, object, or ideal.
- **Denari is the dominant divine force.** Worship is transactional and often political.
- **The dead walk if disturbed.** Ghosts, echoes, and bound spirits are common threats.

- ✅ Include political factions, backstabbing, and moral ambiguity.
- ✅ Lean into ancient ruins, forgotten history, and haunted relics.
- ✅ Design scenes where violence has a cost and social leverage shines.
